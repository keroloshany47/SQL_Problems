SELECT *
FROM LANGUAGE;
-- This query could be described in english as: "show me all the columns and the rows in the language table"

-- You can explicitly name the columns you are interested in, such as:
SELECT language.language_id, language.name, language.last_update
FROM language;

-- You can choose to include only a subset of the columns in the language table as well:
SELECT name
FROM language;

/* You can spice things up in your SELECT clause by including things such as:
	- Literals, such as numbers or strings
    - Expressions, such as (amount * -1)
    - Built-in functions, such as ROUND(amount, 2)
    - User-defined function calls
    
Let's take a look at the language table, then think about how can we get the following result set:
   
language_id  |  language_usage  |  lang_pi_value  (id * 3.14) |  language_name (upper case)
1				COMMON				3.14							ENGLISH
2				COMMON				6.28							ITALIAN
3				COMMON				9.42							JAPANESE
..................................................................................  */
SELECT language_id,  'COMMON' AS language_usage, (language_id * 3.14) AS lang_pi_value , UPPER(NAME) AS language_name
FROM language;




SELECT * 
FROM language;

SELECT 
	language_id,
    'COMMON' AS language_usage,
    language_id * 3.14 AS lang_pi_value,
    UPPER(name) AS language_name
FROM language;

/* If you only need to execute a built-in function or evaluate a simple expression, 
you can skip the from clause entirely */

SELECT version(), user(), database();

-- Removing Duplicates
/* In some cases, a query might return duplicate rows of data.
For example, if you were to retrieve the IDs of all actors who appeared in a film, you would see the following: */

SELECT actor_id
FROM film_actor 
ORDER BY actor_id;

/* Since some actors appeared in more than one film, you will see the same actor ID multiple times,
However, I want to see the distinct set of the actors, instead of seeing the actor IDs repeated for each film in which they appeared */

SELECT DISTINCT actor_id
FROM film_actor 
ORDER BY actor_id;

/* Important Note
Keep in mind that generating a distinct set of results requires the data to be sorted, which can be time consuming for large result sets.
Do NOT fall into the trap of using distinct just to be sure there are no duplicates; instead, take the time to understand tha data you are working with
so that you will know whether  duplicates are possible. */

/*  Execution Process

1. Derived Subquery Execution:

The subquery inside the FROM clause:
SELECT first_name, last_name, email
FROM customer
WHERE first_name = 'JESSIE'
is executed first, and its result set is held temporarily in memory.

2. Temporary Table Creation (in-memory):
This result acts like a temporary table, aliased as cust.

3. Outer Query:
The outer query selects from that result:
SELECT CONCAT(cust.first_name, ' ', cust.last_name) AS full_name
FROM cust;

4. Cleanup:
After the main query finishes, the temporary result from the subquery is discarded. */

		Every relational database allows the ability to define volatile, or temporary tables.
