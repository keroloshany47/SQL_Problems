##  Technologies Used

This repository contains problem-solving SQL scripts written primarily in:

 ![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-Server-blue?logo=microsoftsqlserver)
 ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-Used-blue?logo=mysql)

Each file is tailored based on the platform's dialect (LeetCode uses MySQL, HackerRank supports both, SQL-Practice also uses MySQL).  
I aim to demonstrate versatility across different SQL engines while maintaining clean and readable query logic.

##  My Goals
-  Become SQL-proficient for real-world data tasks.
-  Master complex query techniques using modern SQL.
-  Build a strong portfolio through consistency and exploration.
