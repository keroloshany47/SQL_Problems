## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This repository contains problem-solving SQL scripts written primarily in:

 ![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-Server-blue?logo=microsoftsqlserver)
 ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-Used-blue?logo=mysql)


Each file is tailored based on the platform's dialect ( LeetCode uses MySQL, HackerRank supports both).  
I aim to demonstrate versatility across different SQL engines while maintaining clean and readable query logic.
